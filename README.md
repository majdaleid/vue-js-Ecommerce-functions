# Vue.js 3 Practice Project

This repository houses a practical demonstration of a Vue.js 3 application, making use of the standard Vue.js options API. The code is readily adaptable for use with Vue.js's Composition API, a newer addition to the Vue.js ecosystem, to promote code reuse and organization.

## Running the Project Locally

Navigate to the project directory and start the development server using the following commands:

```bash
cd /vue3-project/vue-project
npm run dev


## Key Concepts Demonstrated

The application provides hands-on experience with various fundamental Vue.js concepts, including:

- **Vue Components:** Implementing multiple components such as `ProductCart`, `HomeView`, and `Sidebar`.
- **Props:** Passing down props (e.g., `cart`, `inventory`, `toggle`) from parent components to children.
- **Event Handling:** Communicating between child and parent components through events.
- **Directives:** Making use of essential Vue.js directives, such as `v-for`, `v-if`, and `v-bind`.
- **Computed Properties:** Creating dynamic and reactive data with computed properties.
- **v-model:** Implementing two-way data binding with `v-model`.
- **Vue Router:** Implementing navigation and routing in the application using Vue Router.
